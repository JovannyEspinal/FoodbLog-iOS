# FoodbLog

FoodbLog is a food diary that allows you to log your experiences with food to capture the delicious meals that you wish to remember.  Along with being able to log your experience, you'll be able to attach the restaurant you were at, and even be able to look up any recipes related to that food thanks to the Foursquare and Food2Fork API, respectively.

If you just want to browse pictures of food, you'll be able to head on to the Food Feed and search for pictures of the food of your liking. Or, if you're looking for inspiration, you can search for a recipe instead and be presented with tons of recipes to choose from.
